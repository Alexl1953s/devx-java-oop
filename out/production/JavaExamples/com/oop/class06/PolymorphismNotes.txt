METHOD OVERLOADING - It's design that java will allow to have more than one method in the same class with same name
But you need to follow one of the two condition:
    1) Either Number of Parameters Can be Different
    2) Or Type of Parameter can be different

    Example - String methods like indexOf() or replace or subString()

METHOD OVERRIDING - When we have two classes with parent child relationship, child class can have same method name
with same parameter that we have in parent but child class can change implementation. So child class overriding parent
class method

Another Definition - it's a design that java will allow to have same method & same parameters (same method exactly!)
But one method will be in parent & another one in child class & Child class can change implementation of method

    Example - Pending, we'll get more example once we cover abstraction & from selenium as well


Dynamic polymorphism - When we use reference of parent class & object of child class, we're using dynamic
polymorphism
