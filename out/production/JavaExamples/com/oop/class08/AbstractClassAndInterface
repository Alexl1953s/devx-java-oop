Abstract class :

1. Abstract class can have abstract as well as non abstract methods (0 to 100% abstraction)
2. Abstract class should be declared with abstract keyword
3. We cannot create object of abstract class
4. If we have at least one method inside the class is abstract we need to make class abstract
5. Abstract class can have constructor / instance variable & constructor will get executed when we create
   object of child class
6. Abstract class can have static method

Interface

1. We canâ€™t instantiate an interface in java. That means we cannot create the object of an interface
2. Interface provides full abstraction as none of its methods have body. On the other hand abstract class provides partial abstraction as it can have abstract and concrete(methods with body) methods both.
3. implements keyword is used by classes to implement an interface.
4. While providing implementation in class of any method of an interface, it needs to be mentioned as public.
5. Class that implements any interface must implement all the methods of that interface, else the class should be declared abstract.
6. All the interface methods are by default abstract and public.
7. Variables declared in interface are public, static and final by default.
8. Interface variables must be initialized at the time of declaration otherwise compiler will throw an error
9. An interface can extend any interface but cannot implement it. Class implements interface and interface extends interface
10. A class can implement any number of interfaces.
